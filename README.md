## Overview

This component is created on top of the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library.
It requires **Mantine 9.x** and **React 19**.

[Mantine JsonTree](https://gfazioli.github.io/mantine-json-tree) provides a structured, interactive view of heterogeneous data—strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, objects, arrays, and even functions—organized as a collapsible tree. Developers can control initial expansion, show visual indent guides, and customize expand/collapse controls with arbitrary React nodes (e.g., emojis or styled icons) to match their design system. For function values, the component offers flexible rendering modes: show the function signature as text, hide functions entirely, or inspect them as objects when needed.

Set `editable` and the same tree becomes an editor: click a string or a number to change it in place, click a boolean to toggle it. Updates are immutable and rebuild only the path down to the edited node, so every `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `RegExp`, `BigInt`, function and React element elsewhere in the tree keeps its identity.

Wrapped with Mantine layout primitives like Paper, Stack, and SimpleGrid, JsonTree integrates cleanly into dashboards, developer tools, and documentation pages where readable, navigable data visualization is essential.

## Features

- Interactive collapsible tree view for any JSON-serializable data
- **In-place editing** of strings, numbers and booleans (`editable`, `onChange`) — immutable updates that
  leave every `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `RegExp`, `BigInt`, function and React element in the tree untouched
- **Search** with text highlight, filtered tree view, and auto-expand matching branches
- **Redesigned toolbar** with key count badge, global copy, search toggle, and modern icons
- **Paper wrapper** with `withBorder` for bordered container look
- **Custom root name** via `rootName` prop
- Syntax highlighting with customizable colors for 16+ data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, Date, RegExp, Map, Set, BigInt, Symbol, React elements, etc.)
- Safe on object graphs: circular references are marked `[Circular]` instead of crashing, while
  shared non-circular references still expand everywhere they appear
- Dark mode support with automatic color adaptation
- Copy-to-clipboard on individual nodes + global copy all JSON
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Space to expand, Ctrl+C to copy)
- Configurable expansion depth with expand/collapse all controls
- Controlled expand/collapse state with `expanded` and `onExpandedChange` props
- Line numbers display
- Visual indent guides with rotating color palette
- Path tooltip on hover showing full JSON path
- Max height with scrollable container
- Sticky header support with configurable offset
- Function display modes: as-string, hide, or as-object introspection
- Responsive font size via Mantine breakpoint objects (CSS-native, no re-renders)
- Full Mantine Styles API support with 21 style selectors and 25+ CSS variables
- Custom icons for expand/collapse and copy controls
- Item count badges for objects and arrays
- `onExpand`, `onCollapse`, `onNodeClick`, `onCopy`, and `onCopyAll` callbacks

## Installation

```sh
npm install @gfazioli/mantine-json-tree
```
or 

```sh
yarn add @gfazioli/mantine-json-tree
```

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree/styles.css';
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { JsonTree } from '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree';

function Demo() {
  return <JsonTree data={{ key: "value" }} />;
}
```

To let a reader change values, add `editable` and feed `onChange` back through `data` — `JsonTree` keeps no copy of your data:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { JsonTree } from '@gfazioli/mantine-json-tree';

function Demo() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({ key: 'value', count: 1, enabled: false });

  return <JsonTree data={data} editable onChange={setData} />;
}
```

## Vorm fork: controlled editing demo

This fork adds `JsonTreeEditor` with recoverable inline drafts and row actions.
Import the package stylesheet and wrap your application in `MantineProvider`.
Basic JSON values choose Mantine text, number and Boolean inputs. Applications
can select semantic editors explicitly with `metadata` and `resolveEditor`;
see `examples/editors/semantic-editors.tsx` for calendars, colors, choices and
precision-preserving decimal/BigInt text. There is no inference from strings.

```tsx
<JsonTreeEditor
  data={value}
  editable
  structure
  defaultExpanded
  onChange={(next) => setValue(next)}
/>
```

Click a value to edit and Apply or Cancel the draft. Use the row's Actions menu
for property changes, insertion or deliberate type replacement, including null.
Array entries have drag grips and keyboard-accessible move buttons. Dragging
shows an insertion line and supports same-array movement only. Escape cancels.
Advanced structure controls retain path selection for hidden or collapsed nodes.
The host owns accepted data and history; `onChange` notification alone is not
acceptance until the next value is supplied through `data`.

Run the independent example from this checkout:

```sh
node .yarn/releases/yarn-4.18.1.cjs install --immutable
node .yarn/releases/yarn-4.18.1.cjs build
cd examples/editors
node ../../node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js . --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4174
```

A registered whole-value array/object editor occupies a single labelled row. Its
custom value replaces the expandable raw children; unregistered containers keep
the normal tree presentation. Search still matches the underlying values.
